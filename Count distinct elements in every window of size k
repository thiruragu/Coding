'''Micorsoft Interview QUestion - Count distinct elements in every window of size k


Given an array of size n and an integer k, return the count of distinct numbers in all windows of size k.
Example:

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 2, 3};
       k = 4
Output: 3 4 4 3

Explanation:
First window is {1, 2, 1, 3}, count of distinct numbers is 3
Second window is {2, 1, 3, 4} count of distinct numbers is 4
Third window is {1, 3, 4, 2} count of distinct numbers is 4
Fourth window is {3, 4, 2, 3} count of distinct numbers is 3

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 4};
       k = 2
Output: 2 2 1

Explanation:
First window is {1, 2}, count of distinct numbers is 2
First window is {2, 4}, count of distinct numbers is 2
First window is {4, 4}, count of distinct numbers is 1
